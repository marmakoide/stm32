# STM32 tutorial projects

This repository is a set of small educational STM32 projects I did for my 
personal entertainment and enlightenment. The development environment is Linux, 
plain C/C++, Makefile, and a shell.

Unless specified otherwise, those projects are targeting the STM32 Nucleo-64 
L476RG board.
